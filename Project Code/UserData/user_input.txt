    'Take a full-length TOEIC mock test under timed conditions (Listening and Reading). Use a quiet environment, follow actual time limits (45 min for Listening, 75 min for Reading), and record your answers on an answer sheet. After the test, log which parts were most difficult for review.',
    'Complete the `txt → dict` parsing logic. Ensure the code can extract title, date, time, description, and location from sample text. Write unit tests using at least 5 varied text samples. If working with LLMs, verify prompt reliability and token limit behavior.',
    'Do a 30-minute walk or stretching session to reset your mind and reduce sedentary fatigue. Avoid intense workouts—focus on posture and mobility.',
    'Review errors from the mock test. Identify misunderstood grammar, skipped vocab, and fast audio sections. Use a notebook to write out corrections and explanations. Spend 45–60 min on targeted vocab drills using flashcards or apps like Quizlet.',
    'Start building the Streamlit UI. Create a basic input form for text upload or paste, and display extracted event data in a table. Ensure real-time feedback on parsing success and highlight missing fields in red for error handling.',
    '20-minute light workout (push-ups, squats, core planks). Keep it short and energizing—no exhaustion.',
    'Take another full-length TOEIC simulation. Use a different mock test set. Focus on pacing and stress control. After the test, review briefly—but don’t overanalyze. Rest is more important today.',
    'Finalize the Streamlit app with complete functionality. Add button for JSON/CSV export, clear form function, and testing with various text formats. Push to GitHub and write a short README outlining functionality.',
    'Take a walk for 30 minutes, ideally outdoors. Reflect on your preparation mentally and wind down.',
    'Test Day. Wake up early, eat well, and arrive at the test center 30 minutes ahead. Bring ID, pens/pencils, and confirmation slip. Stay calm—don’t study today. Trust your preparation.',
    'Light stretching to stay calm and grounded before or after the test. Nothing strenuous.'
